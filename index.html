        My hobbies are art, gaming,reading books, and listening to music. I like to draw, paint and make sculptures in art. I play various games and post videos of them on YouTube. I read many books and can read 700 pages in a day but unfortunately amazon is not fast enough. I listen to many different music playlist created by others on YouTube.

     I read many books from many authors. I can easily read 700 pages with 100 words on each page in 2-3 hours. It is just that unfortunately Amazon cannot deliver books fast enough. Some of my favourite authors are- Rick Riordan, J.K. Rowling, Peter Lerangis, Brandon Mull, Jhon Flangan,Pittacus Lore,J.C. Cervantis, Angie Sage, Christopher Paolini, Eoin Colfer, Scott Mebus, K.L. Armstrong and Melissa Marr. I also have a few 10-20 more authors i like but i just cannot remember their names because each author writes at least 2 series with at least 3 books soooooo..... i really can't remember all.
